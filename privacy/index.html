Here at Taldea, we want you to be informed and comfortable with how we collect and use your information. Taking a few minutes to read this document will help you make informed decisions and get the most out of our platform, ensuring your experience is safe and personalized.</p> <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6">Your Privacy, Our Commitment</h2> <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 pt-4">At Taldea, we deeply value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. Here we explain how we handle your personal data and how you can manage it effectively.</p> <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6">Information Collection</h2> <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 pt-4">We only collect your phone number and photographs for identity verification purposes, which are fundamental to offering you a personalized and secure experience at Taldea.</p> <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6">Use of Information</h2> <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 pt-4">We primarily use your phone number to identify you within the platform, which is essential for maintaining a secure and reliable environment. The photographs uploaded for identity verification are used exclusively to confirm that you are who you say you are and to enhance the reliability of interactions within the community.</p> <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6">Photos and Privacy</h2> <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 pt-4">All photos you upload to Taldea are private by default and will only be accessible to other users with your consent. Only in cases of reports for inappropriate content will Taldea access these photos to verify compliance with our community standards.</p> <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6">Sharing Information</h2> <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 pt-4">We commit to keeping your personal information confidential and will only share it in specific circumstances that require legal compliance or are necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Taldea community.</p> <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6">International Transfer</h2> <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 pt-4">We commit to keeping your personal information confidential and will only share it in specific circumstances that require legal compliance or are necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Taldea community.</p> <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6">International Transfer</h2> <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 pt-4">As we operate internationally, your personal information, such as your phone number and photographs, may need to be transferred and stored on servers located in other countries. We ensure that these transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your information is adequately protected.</p> <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6">Third-Party Services</h2> <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 pt-4">We use third-party services to improve the functionality of our platform, such as analytics providers that help us understand how our application is used. We ensure that these providers operate under strict data protection standards and with the same level of security and respect as we do.</p> <p class="text-2xl text-gray-600 pt-4">We know that reading the Privacy Policy is not precisely the most exciting adventure, but your effort shows how much you care about your privacy and how you interact with Taldea. Not everyone takes the time to read these texts (yes, we know!), so we especially thank you for being part of the select group that does. Your commitment to security and transparency helps us build a better community for everyone!</p> <p class="text-m text-gray-400 pt-10">Last update January 2025</p> </div> </div> </section> </main>  </body></html>
